GPS_Sessions
=============

EDA_GPS_Sessions  
These session times are first come first serve.

It is my understanding there are people that need to do gps for weeks 3&4 from Kakapo and 6&7 from Pukeko.

Taking Christmas into account and the fact we all want a stress-less holiday there will be times over the weekend before Christmas and  between Christmas and new year.

Please put your name and the gps you want to do in the schedule provided.

The after xmas schedule is yet to be written. i will send a notice out closer to the time detailing time slots.

As always get in touch if there is anything you need to discuss, we understand its a busy time of the year
